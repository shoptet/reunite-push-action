  # In TypeScript actions, `dist/` is a special directory. When you reference
  # an action with the `uses:` property, `dist/index.js` is the code that will be
  # run. For this project, the `dist/index.js` file is transpiled from other
  # source files. This workflow ensures the `dist/` directory contains the
  # expected transpiled code.
  #
  # If this workflow is run from a feature branch, it will act as an additional CI
  # check and fail if the checked-in `dist/` directory does not match what is
  # expected from the build.
